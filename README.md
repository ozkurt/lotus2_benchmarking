"Demultiplexing" of the Soil-16S dataset in the QIIME 2-Deblur pipeline slightly differs from the demultiplexing of the Gut-16S dataset. Please see QIIME2-Deblur_Soil_16S.sh for further information.
"Denoising" and "Taxonomy" of the Gut- and Soil-16S datasets are performed using the same QIIME 2 commands.
